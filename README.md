# Rubik-s-Cube-Solver-with-Numpy-and-OpenCV

Using the powerful combination of Numpy and OpenCV, I built a Rubik’s Cube solver that kicks into action the moment you present it with a scrambled cube. 🌈🔄 The magic unfolds as the computer skillfully rearranges the colors to achieve the elusive end goal!


🔍 How does it work?

- OpenCV captures the cube's current state through the camera.

- Numpy helps process the image data, identifying each color on the cube's faces.

- The solver algorithm strategically computes the moves required to unscramble the cube.
